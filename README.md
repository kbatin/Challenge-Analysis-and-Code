# Leveraging Hurricane Maria's Impact

This project analyzes the long-term ecological and infrastructural effects of Hurricane Maria using Sentinel-2 satellite data and object detection methods. We assess the vegetation health across different regions of Puerto Rico through NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) analysis, focusing on the changes pre- and post-hurricane. Additionally, a YOLO model is built for object detection to help identify and classify areas impacted by the disaster.

### Key Sections:

- **Introduction to the Challenge:**
-- Puerto Rico's vulnerability to natural disasters is exacerbated by its terrain and climate, making disaster resilience a critical topic. This study explores how communities can recover more effectively by analyzing the vegetation health pre- and post-Hurricane Maria. We highlight the island’s struggle with power outages, the need for resilient housing, and the importance of disaster preparedness in mitigating the long-term impacts of climate change.

### Actionable Insights:

Affordable, Disaster-Resistant Housing: Governments should collaborate with non-profits and architects to support the building of sustainable homes, especially in areas vulnerable to hurricanes. This includes ensuring infrastructure is durable and accessible in emergencies.
Improving Disaster Preparedness: Puerto Rico faces more frequent hurricanes, making it essential to improve forecasting and communication systems. Drawing inspiration from Japan’s disaster education programs can enhance community preparedness.
Enhanced Insurance Models: Parametric insurance models, based on hazard criteria like hurricane strength, could provide faster recovery funding, ensuring affected communities can rebuild efficiently.
